# The C (and Rust) Programming Language

> All exercises from the famous K&R book implemented in both C and Rust!

2020 is the year to learn even more about programming. Why not start learning the C language? Why not learn Rust as well?

Language war is not new. You can find a lot of people saying that Rust will replace C in the future because of all of its security features. Some others are saying C will never go away, as it is the foundation of most things used today. This repo is a shy initiative to those seeking to learn both languages and maybe get the best of both worlds.

**Just don't fight the Borrow Checker and don't let those pointer dereferences scare you!**

```
!!! Disclaimer !!!

This repo is intended as a way to learn about syntax and structure from both languages. It is not supposed to be a deep comparison of their features. These are for demonstration/educational purposes only.
